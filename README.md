# Fins (Rocket Themes)

This is a set of 17 "themes" for [Rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/)

If you're not familiar with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) or SSGs in general, or more specifically the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) trend with all 200+ implementations - the this all might be too foreign, but if you're already plugged into this world, these themes give that world a more of a WordPress-ish theme-like approach some validity.

## Where is the Documentation?

[WebAppWriter.com/fins](https://webappwriter.com/fins/) is where virtually all of the documentation for these themes can be found, such as [installation](https://webappwriter.com/fins/installation/shellscript/)

Issues are still logged here on github, but you could also DM me directly on the lit-and-friends slack channel. @Pete Carapetyan. No guarantees on response time, obviously.

## Status:

Everything here is still pretty P.O.C. even if it is pretty nifty, compared to what you can do elsewhere.

CREDITS: This project is 99% dependent on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/),and then [Rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/), on top of that. So you are reminded that _**the lift provided by these themes is very light**_, in comparison.
